# Working with the Square API

The `square` package from npm is used to easily interact with the Square API. Documentation for the SDK is available [here](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sdks/nodejs).

We work with the Checkout API's payment links. [Docs](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/checkout-api/create-payment-link)
